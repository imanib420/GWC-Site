  <h2> Stonewall Riot </h2>
  <p> During 1969, homosexuality was still considered a crime, so men were arrested for dressing in "drag" and women were arrested if they had less than three pieces of "feminine clothing" on. June 28, 1969 at a bar, Stonewall Inn a well known gay bar and went to make arrests, but instead of the patreons waiting to get arrsted they fought back and rioted effectively sending a message of their frustrations to the government. That's why this month is known as Pride Month. </p>
